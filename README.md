# IMAGE-PROCESSING-USING-EDGE-SOBEL-DETECTION-AND-CANNY-EDGE-DETECTION-ON-ZEDBOARD-FPGA
This project aims to create custom IP's for Edge Sobel and Canny edge detection for Zedboard. For testing its functionality we use a 512*512 bmp image as input. The code for both IP's are written in verilog language. At last both IP's are compared and analyzed based on its edge detection accuracy, power utilization and resource utilization on FPGA.
